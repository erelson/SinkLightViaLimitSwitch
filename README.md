SinkLightViaLimitSwitch
=======================

An ATtiny85 powered contraption: a limit switch triggers light initially, 
and lights go out once a PIR sensor doesn't detect motion for 30 s.

This is a barebones project that builds with WebbotLib 2.0 (C, not C++).
It's done quick and easy, and overly-done... But it works great while
I figure out how to do a much lower level version that is purely timer
and interrupt driven.
